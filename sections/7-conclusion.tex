In conclusion, this project achieved its core objectives by developing a robot that can map its environment, localize itself within the map, and navigate large open spaces. While some refinements are necessary, particularly with the global path planner and dead reckoning, these issues do not significantly impact the robot's overall performance. More importantly, this project introduces the fundamentals of SLAM and autonomous navigation, which can be used for the development more complex robots in the future.
